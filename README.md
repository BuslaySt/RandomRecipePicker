<h2>Project Files</h2>
<b>starter_files</b>
<br>
<br>
this directory contains the starter files required to follow my YouTube tutorial.

- 2 logos inside the <b>assets</b> folder
- 2 .ttf fonts inside the <b>fonts</b> folder (downloaded from Google Fonts)
- 1 database file inside the <b>data</b> folder
- 1 .png wireframe inside the root folder.
- 1 .py file inside the root folder containing the most basic commands to run a Tkinter window.

<b>complete_project_WINDOWS</b>
<br>
<br>
this directory contains the complete application, created by following the YouTube tutorial.
<br>
as this app uses custom fonts, it's suitable for Windows users only.
<br>
an non-OS-dependant version of this project will be uploaded shortly.
<br>
in addition to all the files specified in starter_files, this directory contains:

- requirements.txt generated by "pip freeze"
- requirements_conda.txt generated by "conda list" especially for Anaconda users

<b>please note!</b> I've added some horizontal padding with <b>padx=25</b> both for the title and ingredients.
<br>
everything else is a 100% match to the code presented in the tutorial (+ helpful comments)
